Prob not going to work buttt

When we create a studygroup
A new folder must be created
In the folder we then create a new text file that store the information of the chat room similar to chat logs
in the format of 
[Type][Date][Group(although it should be know)][Name][message]

[Type]: [Update][Delete][Creation]
[Date]: [MM/DD/YYYY/ HH/MM/SS TIMEZONE]
[Group]: [ID KEY NAME]
[Name]: [ID KEY FULLNAME
[Message]: [Literally just the message]

Plan:
Assume that the Folder(Study group key) with the file(chat room key)already exist

Create message
    Before we do the file stuff acutally create the object in the database
    Go the parent CWD then into the study group key folder then into the chatroom id file
    Open the chatroom id file in "a" mode something like that
    With the corret information after we filter the objects and get necessary data 
    foramt it and then write it

Use the same process for deleting and updating the messagess
